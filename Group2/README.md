<h3>Business Goals</h3>
<b>This data collected could be used to answer the following questions:</b><br/>
1. Is there any correlation between the local weather around the hotel location and Review Types (negative/positive)?
	<u>Purpose:</u> Find patterns of negative positive reviews correlated to off/on-season stays</br></br>
2. Is there any correlation between the review type (negative/positive) and reviewersâ€™ attributes (demographic/geographic)?
	<u>Purpose:</u> segmentation of the population which would be likely to review positively/negatively hotels</br></br>
3. Generative model for new scoring for hotel location that leverages nearby attractions, restaurants and points of interest along with distance from city center ables to predict negative or positive reviews?
	<u>Purpose:</u> Generate combined data and scoring based on different parameters and 3rd party data.</br>
4. What should be a predicted price/night for a hotel based on its similarity to other hotels, based on location (lat,lon), count of reviews, reviewers metadata?</br>
